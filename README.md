**NOTE: "IT Toolshed" is intended as a front-end for DEMO purposes only.**

## How will this Accelerator Help?

This repo contains example code as a guide to help with the following scenarios.

* Automating the storage of credentials after a provisioning event.  E.g. automating saving of EC2 credentials into PAS Vault after the EC2 instance has been provisioned.
* How to setup Conjur to connect without hard coding credentials in a config file.  E.g. Using the Conjur AWS authenticator to fetch credentials from Conjur without storing Conjur user's credentials, rather, this setup will use an AWS Role that Conjur is configured to recognize when a client is authenticating.

## Prerequisites

To use this solution accelerator, you will need:

* An AWS account
  * AWS User -- used for provisioning an EC2 instance
  * AWS Role -- used for Conjur AWS Authenticator
* CyberArk PAS Vault created and ready to go
  * Safe to store provisioner credentials
  * Safe to store the newly created credentials
* CyberArk Conjur Cloud account
  * PAS Vault sync enabled
  * AWS Authenticator configured and enabled
* Access to a Demo Host -- Optimal demo experience, run this from an EC2 instance
* GO lang compiler, v1.21
* GNU Make, v3.81

### -Required- AWS Account And Demo Host Setup

1. AWS User with permissions to Create Tags, Create Key Pairs, and Create EC2 instances.
   1. Create AWS Key and Secret credentials to be used for the "Provisioning" of resources.  E.g. these creds will be used to provision a new keypair and new ec2 instance.
   2. Store these credentials in your PAS Vault, and ensure they are synchronized to Conjur.
2. ARN for the AWS Role to assign to your EC2 demo host.
   * Bind this role to the EC2 instance where you run this demo code from.
   * **OR**
   * IF running from NON EC2 host, like a linux or mac machine, then setup the AWS CLI to run as a user that can ***AssumeRole*** to the role created above.

### -Required- CyberArk PAS Vault

1. Create a safe for storing the Provider credentials.  The AWS Key and Secret created above in step 1 should be stored here.  These creds will be synchronized to Conjur and read from Conjur.
2. **Safe Name** -- Create a safe for storing the new resource's account information.  This safe will be where the new EC2 instance creds will be stored.  Only the safe needs to be created, and **the credentials to access the safe will be entered in the toolshed UI**.  This simulates the developer requesting the resource to be created, and then the developer enters their safe's credentials.

### -Required- Conjur Cloud Setup

1. Create an AWS User with permissions associated to Conjur for "authn-iam" connector
   * Create Access Key and Secret for this user
   * Store these credentials in your PAS Vault safe
2. Install Conjur IAM Authenticator
   * See the `./etc` directory for example setup.
   * See the `load-policies.sh` script for an example of how to load the policies.
   * Conjur CLI install instructions can be found on the [CyberArk Conjur CLI page](https://docs.cyberark.com/conjur-enterprise/13.0/en/Content/Developer/CLI/cli-setup.htm).
   * (Optional) `./etc/iam-check.py` script can help with
     troubleshooting the Conjur AWS Authenticator configuration.

3. Enable PAS Vault sync

## Demo Setup and Usage

**IMPORTANT** - Please read and configure the resources as specified in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section before proceding with the demo.

It is recommended to run this demo from an EC2 instance.  This demo can be run from linux/mac machine with extra setup.

### Steps to run through the demo

* [Scenario - Hard Coding Credentials](README-scenario1.md)
* [Scenario - Conjur AWS Authenticator](README-scenario2.md)

### Configuration Files

This section will describe the contents of the fields for each of the configuration files.

#### PAS Config File

Copy the example config file, `./cmd/provengine/pasconfig-example.toml` with name `./cmd/provengine/pasconfig.toml`

Here is what the example looks like.

```ini
[pasvault]

# Cloud Identity Portal (ID Tenant where the user is managed)
idtenanturl = "https://IDENTITY_TENANT_ID.id.cyberark.cloud"

# Safe owner/user must enter PAS Vault user/pass in Toolshed UI

# Privilege Cloud (Where the Vault-safe is located)
pcloudurl = "https://example-demo-toolshed.privilegecloud.cyberark.cloud"
safename = "toolshed-safe1"
```

## Workflow Diagrams

### Scenario 1 -- Provider Credentials in a File

Provider credentials have permissions to create, modify and delete resources at the provider.  For this demo, AWS is the provider.  This scenario is used to contrast with Scenario 2 so that one can see the differences between the two.

<!--
```plantuml
@startuml images/Scenario1Diagram.svg
title Scenario 1 -- Provider Credentials in a File
participant ProvEngine as "Provision Engine\n(Ex: in-house app)"
participant Provisioner as "Provisioner\n(Ex: Terraform)"
participant Provider as "Provider\n(Ex: AWS)"

ProvEngine -> ProvEngine: Read Provider creds\n<b>from a file</b>
ProvEngine -> Provisioner: Pass Provider creds
Provisioner -> Provider: (with Provider creds) Request resource
Provider -> Provider: Create resource
Provider -> Provisioner: Send Resource Details
Provisioner -> ProvEngine: Send Resource Details
ProvEngine -> ProvEngine: Store New Resource\ndetails in PAS Vault

```

![Scenario 1 Diagram](images/Scenario1Diagram.svg)

### Scenario 2 -- Provider Credentials from Conjur

This scenario demonstrates the separation of concerns by using 2 sets of AWS credentials, one set of credentials is used to authenticate to Conjur Cloud, and the other set of credentials is used to provision resources in AWS.

<!--
```plantuml
@startuml images/Scenario2Diagram.svg
title Scenario 2 - Provider Credentials from Conjur
participant ProvEngine as "Provision Engine\n(Ex: in-house app)"
participant Provisioner as "Provisioner\n(Ex: Terraform)"
participant Provider as "Provider\n(Ex: AWS)"

note over ProvEngine #FFAAAA: Use "authn-iam" Authenticator
ProvEngine -> ProvEngine: Read Provider creds\n<b>from Conjur</b>
ProvEngine -> Provisioner: Pass Provider creds
Provisioner -> Provider: (with Provider creds) Request resource
Provider -> Provider: Create resource
Provider -> Provisioner: Send Resource Details
Provisioner -> ProvEngine: Send Resource Details
ProvEngine -> ProvEngine: Store New Resource\ndetails in PAS Vault
@enduml
```
-->
![Scenario 2 Diagram](images/Scenario2Diagram.svg)

There are 2 apps that comprise this demo, the "ITSM App" and the "Provision Engine."   The "ITSM App" provides an intake form for an application developer to make a request for a resource.  The "Provision Engine" will accept the request, call the Provider to request resources to be created, and then store the new resource information in the PAS Vault safe.

Under `cmd/toolshed` is the app that provides a web server app to provide the intake form and forward the request to the provision engine.

Under `cmd/provengine` is the app that will either use the Provider creds from a file (Scenario 1), or, it will call on Conjur Cloud and fetch the provider credentials from there.

The following reference diagram illustrates a high-level process flow whereby a resource is requested, provisioned, and access details are returned to the requestor.  

This diagram illustrates how the toolshed app and the provengine app work together.
